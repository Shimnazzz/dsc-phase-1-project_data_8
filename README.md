### Project Overview

This project involves using various avaiable movie related databases to perform data analysis and derive meaningful insights and recommendations for Microsoft for their new venture to create a new movie studio

### Business Problem

Microsoft as a new entrant in the movie production space, requires expert recommendation in this area. This project looks into catering to this problem and doing analysis of the different movie related attributes and develop findings related to these. These findings will be converted into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

This project will be looking into the following datasets from the above listed ones:

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* imdb.title.principals
* mdb.name.basics
* bom.movie_gross

### Methodology

The above mentioned datasets were used in the analysis done in Jupyter notebook. The datsets were used to understand any correlation between movie related parameters and also to find the best available solutions to create the movie with for Microsoft.

Firstly, using the 

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Microsoft) should take.

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of Microsoft's new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing this assignment, the rubric at the bottom of it, and the "Project Submission & Review" page. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor ASAP.

Next, we recommend you check out [the Phase 1 Project Templates and Examples repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template) and use the MVP template for your project.

Alternatively, you can fork [the Phase 1 Project Repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project), clone it locally, and work in the `student.ipynb` file. Make sure to also add and commit a PDF of your presentation to your repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
